AI-agent is my third [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project

An LLM-powered command-line program capable of reading, updating, and running Python code using the Gemini API. 

A basic implementation designed to demonstrate concepts related to large language models (LLMs), agent-based coding tools, and working with Python code execution across multiple directories.
